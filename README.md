# HackerType with Auto-Type Bot

This is a forked repository of HackerType, enhanced with an experimental Auto-Type Bot for educational and entertainment purposes.

### Original HackerType Description:
Test your coding speed and accuracy by practicing with LeetCode solutions!

### Auto-Type Bot Addition:
I've added an Auto-Type Bot to this project as a fun experiment and to explore the capabilities of browser automation. This bot is designed to automatically type the code snippets, demonstrating how such automation can be implemented.

**Note:** The Auto-Type Bot is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used to manipulate actual typing tests or competitions.

## Features:
- Original HackerType functionality
- Auto-Type Bot with customizable typing speed
- Real-time statistics display (APM, Error Rate, Words Typed, Time Elapsed)
- Easy-to-use interface for starting the Auto-Type Bot

## How to Use the Auto-Type Bot:
1. Open the HackerType page in your browser
2. Install the "Run Javascript" Chrome extension (Note: This extension may be removed by Chrome in the future)
3. Open the extension and paste the contents of `AutoTypeBot.js` (located at the root of this project)
4. Run the code using the extension
5. A control panel will appear on the right side of the screen
6. Click the "Start ðŸš€" button to begin auto-typing

**Important:** Always remove the "Run Javascript" extension after experimenting or testing to ensure browser security.

## Project Structure:
- `README.md`: This file
- `AutoTypeBot.js`: Contains the Auto-Type Bot code (located at the root of the project)

## Disclaimer:
This Auto-Type Bot is a proof-of-concept and should be used responsibly. It is not intended for cheating or gaining unfair advantages in typing tests or competitions.
