Test your coding speed and accuracy by practicing with LeetCode solutions!

## Todo:



- fix CSS (try chakra-ui)
 - have solution range for each lang
 - button for both search and limit
 





## Post-Deploy:
- profile database
- leaderboards
- add search for sol-name, have solutions popup (better search-id function)
- grid showing ALL solutions
  - show's pb
  - each solution has a leaderboard (friend/global)


## Maybe:
- add user-set time limit
- include more stats at the end (words got wrong, graph <- gonna be hard)

## Finished:
- ~~-remove all obscure solutions~~ 
- ~~add comment detection~~
- ~~figure out c++ crash~~
- ~~add disappearing text~~ 
- ~~make word limit to solutions~~ 
- ~~remove the line if user gets it wrong/doesnt press enter~~ 
- ~~update solution range onClick()~~ 
- ~~FIX INDENTATION BUGS~~
- ~~fix word limit number having an offset~~
- ~~select text box even if insta-refresh~~
- ~~RETRY SAME TEST~~
- ~~wordcount lagging behind by 1 solution bug~~
- ~~select solution id~~
- ~~add no paste in user input~~
- ~~nav bar (logo, contact, about)~~
