# HackerType

## Todo:

- fix word limit number having an offset
- better UI obviously it looks garbage rn
- nav bar (logo, contact, about)
- RETRY SAME TEST
- select text box even if insta-refresh






## Post-Deploy:
- profile database
- leaderboards
- grid showing ALL solutions
  - show's pb
  - each solution has a leaderboard (friend/global)


## Maybe:
- add search for sol-name, have solutions popup 
- add user-set time limit
- include more stats at the end (words got wrong, graph <- gonna be hard)

## Finished:
- ~~-remove all obscure solutions~~ 
- ~~add comment detection (easy)~~
- ~~figure out c++ crash (prob comment detection)~~
- ~~add disappearing text~~ 
- ~~make word limit to solutions~~ 
- ~~remove the line if user gets it wrong/doesnt press enter~~ 
- ~~update solution range onClick(), prob have to make func again idk~~ 
- ~~FIX INDENTATION BUGS (conditional, the website fucked some of them up, will fix overtime)~~
